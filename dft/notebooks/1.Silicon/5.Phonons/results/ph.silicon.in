  ! the threshold on the self consistent cycle for each perturbation
  tr2_ph=1.0d-16,

  ! the name needs to be same of the scf calculation
  prefix='si',

  ! the mixing parameter for the scf cycle, smaller it is the higher the chance to converge but the slower the calculation
  alpha_mix(1)=0.5

  !the name of the dynamical matrices
  fildyn='si.dyn',

  ! instruct the code to compute the dielectric constant and the born effective charges (not important here but in polar semiconductors
  epsil=.true.

  ! instruct the code to perform a calculation on an automatic grid and the dimensions of the mesh
  ldisp=.true.
